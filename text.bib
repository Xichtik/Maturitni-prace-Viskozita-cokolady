    abstract={This book is written for scientists involved in the calibration of viscometers. A detailed description for stepping up procedures to establish the viscosity scale and obtaining sets of master viscometers is given in the book. Uncertainty considerations for standard oils of known viscosity are presented. The modern viscometers based on principles of  tuning fork, ultrasonic, PZT, plate waves, Love waves, micro-cantilever and vibration of optical fiber are discussed to inspire the reader to further research and to generate improved versions. The primary standard for viscosity is pure water. Measurements of its viscosity with accuracy/uncertainty achieved are described. The principles of rotational and oscillation viscometers are explained to enhance the knowledge in calibration work. Devices used for specific materials and viscosity in non SI units are discussed with respect to the need to correlate viscosity values obtained by various devices. The description of commercial viscometers meets the needs of the user.},

Similar results can be found in a 2011 article of L. A. Mihai and A. Goriely. We confirm their results under weakened assumptions and consider the case of a shear load, i.e. a Biot pure shear stress. In addition, conditions under which Cauchy pure shear stresses correspond to (idealized) pure shear stretch tensors are stated and a new notion of idealized finite simple shear is introduced, showing that for certain classes of nonlinear materials, the results by Destrade et al. can be simplified considerably.},

The analysis of flow effects on microstructure and rheology remains one of the challenging problems in colloid science. The rheological manifestation of flow-induced structural changes is a variable viscosity. If the changes are reversible and time dependent, the effect is called thixotropy. The basic elements of this concept are reviewed here, including its definition and the relation with nonlinear viscoelasticity. The omnipresence of thixotropy is illustrated with a wide range of examples from natural and manmade colloidal systems. Its various rheological manifestations are reviewed as well as possible measurement procedures. The microstructural changes due to flow are quite complex and not fully understood. Existing models for thixotropic suspension rheology are categorized and evaluated.},

    abstract = {Determining correctly the rheological parameters of the cement paste is a matter of capital importance when designing a self-compacting concrete (SCC). For this, it is necessary to resort to rheometers, which are expensive and, therefore, not available in all laboratories. However, the measurement of plastic viscosity can also be carried out using capillary viscometers, simple and cheap instruments whose foundation lies in the time it takes for a volume of suspension to flow through the hole in a capillary. It is common practice to use the Marsh funnel in the construction industry but not the Cannon–Fenske viscometer, more used in other industries such as chemistry. Besides, most of the models associated with the Marsh funnel have been developed for drilling muds, although there are some exclusive for cementitious suspensions. However, the rheological nature of both materials is very similar, so it seems appropriate to check how these models behave in cement pastes designed for SCC. Consequently, the rheological behavior of 39 cement pastes of different composition was studied (varying the nature of cementitious materials and the superplasticizer admixture, with various water–cementitious materials ratios) to check the performance of said devices and models using the plastic viscosity measured with a rotational rheometer as a reference. The results indicate that the Cannon–Fenske viscometer offers a better approximation to the reference plastic viscosities than the Marsh funnel. As for the comparison between models for the Marsh funnel, the results obtained are disparate, so it would be convenient to expand the experimental research to adjust the parameters of the models that offer a good approach.},

    abstract = {Summary Parameters in chocolate rheology, namely shear viscosity and yield stress, are important in manufacture and directly influenced by product particle size distribution (PSD) and composition. The Casson model was the standard confectionery industry strategy to quantify rheological properties of molten chocolate until in 2000, the International Confectionery Association recommended the use of interpolation data to describe viscosity. The two strategies are compared and correlated in defining rheological properties of molten dark chocolates prepared using different PSD, fat and lecithin content. Rheological parameters were determined using a shear rate-controlled rheometer and data examined using correlation, regression and principal component analyses to establish their inter-relationships. Correlation and regression analyses showed high correlation (r = 0.89–1.00) and regression coefficients (R2 = 0.84–1.00). The newer International Confectionery Association technique gave higher correlation and regression coefficients than the Casson model, but multivariate principal component analysis showed that the two models were highly related and either could effectively quantify dark chocolate viscosity parameters.},

The new method is validated with both research grade rheometers and factory grade viscometers. This includes elements of measurement uncertainty. In this way, a new reference method is validated for the viscosity of chocolate and related cocoa products using factory grade viscometers. It involves recording: (1) the value of the stress at a shear rate of 5 s-1 to represent the yield stress of chocolate, (2) the value of the viscosity at a shear rate of 40 s-1 to represent the high shear viscosity, and (3) the difference between the viscosity measured at a shear rate of 40 s-1 during the ramp up and down in shear rate to represent thixotropy. Results relate to the solid to liquid glass transition of dispersions under applied stress, and it is shown that they reflect existing theories of stress induced formation and rupture of fractal aggregates, for particle crowded colloidal suspensions with low interaction energy.},

Two techniques were used: (a) Zahn cup number 5, and (b) ring/spread test using a ring and a template with concentric circles (ring method). Seven chocolates with a wide range of viscosities were used: (a) three 70\% dark chocolates; (b) 70\% dark chocolate with 1\% lecithin added; (c) 70\% dark chocolate with 10\% cocoa butter added; (d) a Swiss-style milk chocolate; (e) a 50\% milk chocolate. Results from this research showed that the viscosity obtained using the Zahn cups was positively correlated with the Casson plastic viscosity (r = 0.897; p = 0.016) while the values obtained using the ring/spread method were negatively correlated with the Casson yield stress (r = −0.916; p = 0.004) and the Casson plastic viscosity (r = −0.897; p = 0.007). These results are helpful for small producers of chocolate that need to quantify the viscosity of their product using simple and economic techniques.},

    ABSTRACT = {The polymorphic state of edible fats is an important quality parameter in fat research as well as in industrial applications. Nowadays, X-ray diffraction (XRD) is the most commonly used method to determine the polymorphic state. However, quantification of the different polymorphic forms present in a sample is not straightforward. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) is another method which provides information about fat crystallization processes: the different peaks in the DSC spectrum can be coupled to the melting/crystallisation of certain polymorphs. During the last decade, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) has been proposed as a method to determine, qualitatively and/or quantitatively, the polymorphic forms present in fat samples. In this work, DSC- and NMR-deconvolution methods were evaluated on their ability to determine the polymorphic state of cocoa butter, with XRD as a reference method. Cocoa butter was subjected to two different temperature profiles, which enforced cocoa butter crystallization in different polymorphic forms. It was found that XRD remains the best method to qualitatively determine the polymorphic state of the fat. Whereas the quantitative NMR and DSC deconvolution results were not fully in line with the XRD results in all cases, NMR deconvolution showed great promise both in a qualitative and quantitative way.},

Using CBEs in combination with tempering regimens is an option to produce fine chocolates. Thus, CBEs' thermal properties and crystallization kinetics were studied, and the effect of CBE, and tempering regimes on the crystallization kinetics, polymorphism, melting, and physical properties of dark chocolates were determined. The CBE consisted of CB mixtures with coconut oil (CB/CNO) and sacha inchi oil (CB/SIO) in concentrations of 55/45 and 65/35, respectively. CBEs combined with two tempering regimes (high and low) were used to produce Ch-CNO and Ch-SIO dark chocolates, whose thermal data were obtained by Differential Scanning Calorimetry. The adjustment of thermal data to the Avrami equation permitted us to determine that both factors accelerated the crystallization process up to 7.25 ± 0.18 min in Ch-CNO and 7.08 ± 0.15 min in Ch-SIO and produced spherical and plate-like geometries crystallized nuclei. Also, they generated 90.3 ± 1.18 of form β2 in Ch-CNO and 92.56 ± 1.49 in Ch-SIO. Moreover, the chocolates' texture, rheology, color, and melting properties were within acceptable limits. Therefore, using coconut oil and sacha inchi oil as an alternative to traditional CBEs in dark chocolates is feasible.},

Although the crystal structure of cocoa butter has been studied extensively, the molecular interactions between cocoa butter triacylglycerols in relation to polymorphic transformations from metastable forms (forms III and IV) to stable crystal forms (forms V and VI) remain largely unknown. In this review, the triclinic polymorphism and melting profiles of the major triacylglycerols in cocoa butter—POP, POS, and SOS—are reviewed, and their binary and ternary phase behaviors in metastable (pseudoβ′) and stable (β2) crystal forms are discussed. We also attempt to clarify how the transformation of cocoa butter from form IV to V, as a critical step in the tempering of chocolate, is controlled by POS interactions with both POP and SOS. Moreover, we show how the crystal forms V and VI of cocoa butter are templated by crystal forms β3 and β1 of POS, respectively. }

Increasing the concentration of amorphous lactose from spray-dried powders in the chocolates decreased viscosity, increased particle size of refined chocolate mass, and lowered the concentration of surface-active agents at which a minimum in Casson yield value was observed. Increasing the concentration of crystalline lactose from milk powders in the chocolates increased viscosity, decreased particle size, and increased the concentration of surface-active agents at which a minimum in Casson yield value was observed. Conditions which affect lactose crystallinity in milk powders, such as improper storage and handling prior to use in chocolate production, could be responsible for variations in chocolate viscosity noted sometimes by processors.},

    A basic definition of the structure of chocolate would be a fat-continuous matrix within which are particles of cocoa powder, sugar, and, in the case of milk chocolate, milk powder. In terms of the fats, cocoa butter is the one constant in that this is present in the fat phase, whatever the type of chocolate. In dark or plain chocolates, cocoa butter is usually the only fat that is present. Chocolates also contain some form of emulsifier and that could be considered to be a part of the lipid phase of the chocolate. The cocoa components used in chocolate are cocoa butter, cocoa powder, or cocoa mass, which is the combination of both cocoa powder and cocoa butter found naturally in the cocoa bean. Chocolate processing involves a number of stages that can be summarized as: refining, conching, tempering, molding or enrobing, cooling, and packing.},
